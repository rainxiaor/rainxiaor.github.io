        <p>When people ask me "Where are you from?" I generally pause and inwardly chuckle. My response could range from one sentence to several hours long...

        <p>As the oldest child of immigrant parents, I dutifully followed our family's American dream of pursuing the life we wanted for ourselves. My parents moved frequently to take advantage of opportunities in higher education and their careers in the pharmaceutical industry. I found the easiest way to explain this to others was: "My mom makes drugs and my dad sells them." The path of their career ambitions resulted in my Candyland-like childhood, beginning in China and winding across the United States. While uncomfortable at times, the periodic relocation exposed me to an eclectic variety people, cultures, locations, and socio-economic environments that left strong impressions on me.

        <p> My brother Jonathan was born when I was eight years old, and his upbringing and personality are very different from mine (even though we had the same parents and grew up together). As a first generation child, Jon is much more "Americanized" in his values and personality compared to me. While we were not good friends growing up, we are now closer than ever before (ironically as we now live on opposite sides of the country).</p>
        
        <p>I met my husband Dwayne in 2012 after the historic Hurricane Sandy occurred in New York City. This was as I started a new chapter of my life and career, with fresh perspectives. While extremely different in personal background, Dwayne and I share many personal values (like family) and interests (travel, athletics, etc.), and have international families and homes. We were married in 2016 in Ireland and China (our two homelands). Our joint love of travel and adventure has brought us all over the world. You can read about some of these trips in the <a href="explore.html">Explore</a> section of the website. </p>

        <p> My Asian "tiger parents" encouraged me to play the piano and study hard at school. But the more adventurous side of me loved competing and being creative. My  lifelong passions include running, singing, water sports, eco-tourism, and teaching.

            <p>My favorite physical activity is running. I ran track throughout primary school and briefly for a season at Cornell. While living in New York City, I also trained and competed as a member of Central Park Track Club, a semi-professional track and field team. The sport has taught me invaluable traits such as discipline, teamwork, dedication,  attention to detail, and patience. </p>
            <p>Even greater than the thrill of competing, however, is the therapeutic and euphoric release that running affords me. It is unequivocally the most reliable and accessible ways to unwind and get away from everyday responsibilities and stress.

            <p>Equally enjoyable and challenging is my love of singing. Like athleticism, music is a family trait that was passed down to me. My late grandfather was a performer and teacher in the famous Sichuan Opera (in China), and while none of his children followed in his footsteps, they all enjoy singing recreationally. My parents met through singing in college (while coincidentally taking the same academic courses). I studied classical voice and was member of Nothing But Treble, Cornell University's original all-female a cappella group. </p>
            <p>My family has always enjoyed singing together. My brother and I in particular love to arrange versions of popular songs. This video (left) is a sample of a song we sent our loved ones in lieu of holiday card a few years ago. </p>
