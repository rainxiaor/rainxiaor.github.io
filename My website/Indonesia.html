        <h2>Indonesia: Land of Romance & History</h2>
    </div>
    
    <div class="indonesia-homepage-intro-content">
        <p>Known as "Thousand Islands" for (quite literally) its thousands of small floating land masses, Indonesia is surprisingly the world's fourth largest country by population. You might not notice this unless you step in its overpopulated cities, however. In non-urban areas, Indonesia is a lush, rural paradise - perfect for getting away from hectic lifestyles.

    </div>
    
    <div class="bali-content">
        <p>Among its many islands and attractions, I  only visited the region of Bali on my honeymoon. Bali has been largely popularized by the book (and film by the same title) "Eat, Pray, Love" in which an American woman travels to Bali as the last destination on her global trip of self-discovery. Like her, many visitors flock to Bali to discover spiritual re-balance, existential self-discovery, and love in this magical place. Others seeking more social and beach party atmosphere prefer the uber-commercialized downtown Bali scene full of disco clubs, Western restaurants, ultra-modern resorts, and lots of foreigners. Since my desire was the former, I will introduce aspects of Bali which are more suitable for those who enjoy escaping crowds and Western influence to enjoy the local culture and laid-back lifestyle of Bali and its surrounding areas.

            <h2>Ubud</h2>
            <p>Known as the spiritual capital of Bali, Ubud is an ancient cultural and religious center, northeast of downtown by several hours' drive. It is situated among striking rice fields and meandering rivers, as if protected by the gods. The rice paddies are stunning, live examples of thousand-year old agricultural methods that are still in use today. Many tours include trekking in both the jungle and rice fields. Ubud's close proximity to many important holy sites has drawn much tourist traffic in the past few decades. The town center is full of foreigners eager to find spiritual inspiration and refine their meditation practice. There is a plethora of accomodation options and wellness services to suit any interest and budget. </p>

            <h2>Lombok</h2>
            <p>Located roughly an hour east of Bali Island by plane or speedboat, Lombok island is a secluded hideaway that most Bali visitors do not know of. There are only a handful of resorts and hotels, though commercial development is expanding. This is the perfect place to get away from people and relax in a more private setting. Locals and visitors alike enjoy the excellent surfing, fishing, and other underwater activities in the clear aqua waters gently lapping the shores. </p>
                
            <p>The tiny Gili Islands (Gili Trawangan, Gili Air and Gili Meno), off Lombokâ€™s northwest coast, are where many aquatic activities are based. The Gilis offer great beaches, reefs for diving and snorkeling, and sea turtle breeding nests. <a href="https://www.diversiadiving.com/">Diversia Diving</a> is a highly recommended diving company in the Gilis that provides full service diving certification and trips to dive spots around the islands. The Gilis don't offer too many accomodation options, but support the many backpackers, surfers, and divers who inhabit the many hostels and tiny hotels on those islands. Cars are not permitted, so walking and biking are the main transportation modes. </p>

            <h2>Places to Rest</h2>
            <p>Bali has a huge range of accomodation to suit any type, preference, and age of traveler.</p>
            <p>For the budget-minded, there are many cheap hostels and simpler hotels that tie in surfing, trekking, community service, and other activities into affordable experience packages. This makes it extremly popular and feasible for young backpackers and cost-conscious travelers. The party scene is also intense, mostly catering to European and Australian visitors.</p>
            <p>For the majority of travelers, there are hotels, Airbnb, and resorts that span the typical range in any popular international beach destination. Note that some areas are better suited for families vs. couples or solo travelers. There is no alcohol drinking age in Bali, but other drugs are strictly prohibited (and the ban is strongly enforced) by the government.</p>
            <p>At the high end of accomodation lie exclusive resorts and properties with private beaches, bays, and golf courses. World class luxury can be had for slightly less than one might pay for the equivalent service in Europe or Hawaii. </p>
            <p><strong>For our honeymoon, we stayed at two unique properties (both highly recommended):</strong></p>

Guests stay in their own bamboo houses, each with a unique origin and story. The collection of buildings is a stunning architectural feat, an innovative collaboration of ancient and new bamboo construction techniques. The hotel also uses sustainable, recycled energy sources and grows all of its own food. </h5>

Tugu Lombok is a member of the Tugu family of boutique hotels owned by an Indonesian businessman and art collector, who decided to place his expansive Indonesian art and artifacts collection in all of the hotel properties. Tugu Lombok offers pristine, private beaches; personalized experiences with caring servers; and incredible art and history tied to every detail on the enormous and thoughtfully designed property.
