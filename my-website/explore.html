        <p>As a child growing up in America, my family did not have the finances to take trips to exotic lands. We were cheerful enough to cram into our little car and take roadtrips across the US to explore new states, people, national parks, and culture. Exploring the great outdoors was a luxury we never had when living in China, and my childhood vacations engrained in me a deep appreciation for nature.
        </p>
        <p>In my adult life, I've been fortunate to have the opportunity to travel to amazing places for both work and play. Whereas once upon a time I only preferred beach and relaxation destinations, I later learned to appreciate the cultural, artistic, historical, and other important and unique elements of places. When Dwayne and I first exchanged travel experiences in our "getting to know you" days, we immediately realized our mutual love of travel and exploration. We made a pact to "see the world together" and have faithfully adhered to it. We promised each other we would visit at least one new international destination every year. In the last five years we have traveled together to Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Bermuda, Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, England, China, Indonesia, France, Finland, and Hawaii (admittedly, this is in the US but very far away).
        </p>
        <p>I have always wanted to travel blog. While this website won't be a full-blown travel blog, it will encompass a collection of my favorite places and things I've experienced which were truly memorable, that others would also love. Below are a selection of recent memorable destinations I've visited. </p>

        <h2>Indonesia</h2>
    </div>
    
    <div class="indonesia-content">
        <p>Indonesia is the land of romance and history. Fittingly, it's where my husband and I traveled for our honeymoon.  </p>
        <p>Throughout its rich, centuries-old history, tragic stories of colonization by a dozen outside civilizations are repeated every several decades, when the old regime is overthrown by the next. A curious outcome of the many conquering empires, cultures, and religions is that Indonesia today is one of the most diverse countries in Asia. Its inhabitants - native Indonesians, Asian immigrants and their posterity, and recent foreign newcomers - represent and celebrate an extraordinary collection of backgrounds. Most people are unaware that Indonesia is the largest Muslim country in the world, and recognizes six national religions. The country has not experienced any recent terrorist incidents (like those in Europe), and most locals in tourism-popular areas are quick to ensure visitors that it is very safe.
        </p>
        <p> If you're looking for an intriguing land to explore; love history and culture; and appreciate diversity - Indonesia has it all. Did I mention that the food is equally eclectic and unusual? In this country, nearly everything is grown locally; but outsiders' influence and the recent infusion of sophisticated Western cooking techniques has elevated local cuisine to worldly levels. A must-visit for foodies!</p>

        <h2>Ireland</h2>
    </div>
    
    <div class="ireland-content">
        <p>The Emerald Isle is home to lush verdant landscapes, ever-flowing Guinness, and endless story-telling (known as "the craic") by the friendliest people in the world. As a frequent visitor to this country, I have come to love and appreciate the Irish way of life, which is starkly different from the New York state of mind and being.
        </p>
        <p>Most visitors to Ireland are taken aback by its raw natural beauty, paired with the straight, simple nature of everything from colloquialisms to lifestyle. While largely still agrarian, in recent decades Ireland has made impressive strides in newer industries such as high tech and pharmaceuticals. What hasn't changed in centuries are the stories and songs, passed down generations and through the pubs, churches, and town centers. The powerful sense of family and community is what most tightly binds Irish people with their identity - no matter how far they have moved from their hometown.</p>
        <p>Travelers who like exploring rugged landscapes on foot; engaging with friendly locals who will share their life history with you over a pint at the local pub; and driving on the left through meandering hidden roads will fall in love with the small-country charm of Ireland.</p>

        <h2>China</h2>
    </div>
    
    <div class="china-content">
        <p>China is a diverse country and rapidly rising global superpower. The pace of change is so fast that it would not be useful to provide travel advice on China unless it were updated annually (or even more frequently). I encourage visitors to read recent, online travel blogs to keep up to date on China travel. That being said, it is a progressive and increasingly welcoming country with very unique customs, history, and lands that any visitor would enjoy. A visit to China generally requires more (physical and mental) preparation than for most Western destinations. </p>
        
        <p>I was born in China and spent nearly six years growing up in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province (in China's southwest). While not a "first tier" Chinese city (like Beijing, Shanghai, etc.), Chengdu has risen economically with great speed within the last decade and many tourists now include it in their China itinerary. Chengdu's top attraction is the <a href="http://www.panda.org.cn/english/">Giant Panda Breeding Research Base</a> - the only panda breeding center that is also located in the pandas' natural habitat. The city is also known for its spicy, numbing flavors and the colorful dialect and personalities of its people. 
        </p>
        <p>Two other Chinese cities I have briefly lived in and recommend visiting are Beijing and Shanghai, the "must-see" capitals of China. While Beijing is the historic and culturally Chinese capital, Shanghai is the modern and progressively international capital. Each has its pros as well as cons. Fortunate for visitors, both are extremely accessible and English-friendly, and recent government initiatives have made it easier to get to and get around for non-Chinese people. For those who have never visited China before, these cities are good "gateway" destinations to introduce China, before visiting smaller or more remote places (where there are fewer English accomodations and Western luxuries).
