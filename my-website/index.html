        <h2>Life's an Adventure</h2>
    </div>
    
    <div class="homepage-content">
        <p>Welcome to my world. Here you'll find a quick <a href="mepage.html">bio</a> of me and the underlying people and experiences that created who I am today. The rest of the website is dedicated to two things I love: traveling and eating. But first, why this website?</p>
        
        <p>For many years I've wanted to find a channel for self-expression outside of existing platforms and apps. Linked In took care of my professional profile. Facebook allowed me to keep in contact (as close or as far as I wanted) with the people in my past and present. Instagram and YouTube allowed visual representations of life. What I truly wanted was a personalizable channel of my own to show and tell about stuff I love and do. I purchased my own domain name over a decade ago and it sat idly, waiting for me to pick up the coding skills to bring it to life.</p>
        
        <p>Separately, I noticed that members of my social circles often ask each other for advice, recommendations, and referrals by word of mouth. There exist many advice-giving apps and websites covering niche categories such as dining recommendations, travel tips, etc. But do you know or trust the advice givers? Are they paid for their opinions; and are their preferences similar to yours? In many occasions, I have found that I don't agree with Yelp or Tripadvisor reviews; or that the opinions vary so widely, it is hard to form a conclusion. In the end, it truly is best to rely on the recommendations and opinions of people you know and trust. I have provided my recommendations from personal experience in the form of excel sheets, long rambly emails, phone calls, and copied text messages. Over time (as restaurants and hot destinations come and go) the content gets stale, and requires updating. I needed a solution to document and update my experiences, and to provide them at quick notice to people requesting them. 
        </p>
        
        <p>So this is my first go at tackling both of my wants: creating my own channel of self-expression, and dispensing personal recommendations from my travel and dining experiences. It's a work in progress (you can see the unfinished but planned sections). Enjoy and please give me feedback and suggestions for future postings!</p>
